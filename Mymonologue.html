        <b>Chengdu(2017-2021)</b>
        </li>
        <p>
        <br>She spent four years of her Undergraduate life here. In Chengdu, for the first time, 
        she lived on her own and was able to decide what she ate, where she went and what she did.
        She met people she could spend her life with and met some interesting friends.Chengdu is a beautiful and pleasant place to live. 
        In the years she has been away from Chengdu, she has always felt that in another parallel time and space, she must eventually return to 
        Chengdu to spend the rest of her life. The willingness for freedom led her to this city, and during the four years she lived in Chengdu, She 
        learned how Chinese people fought for freedom and democracy and how they were sacrificed at the hands of an authoritarian government.

        <b>Guangzhou(2020-2021)</b>
        </li>
        <p>
        <br>She only lived in Guangzhou for 3 month. However, given life in Guangzhou was such an important part of her life in finding herself, 
        she must mention the city.She went to Guangzhou because of the attraction of Cantonese culture since she was a child. In Guangzhou, 
        she interned in a famous media; she grew up a lot as she left the dormitory to live on her own and dealt with the big and small things in life. 
        More than once she rode her bike alone for a walk along the Pearl River, which was the high point of her life in Guangzhou.

        </li>
        <p>
        <br>She started her first job as a journalist in Beijing. At the starting time, she didn't anticipate that this would be her last job in Beijing and in China.
        Beijing is not a city fit for human habitation, but there are still places she loves, such as the Liangma River and Chaoyang Park.During the two years she lived in the city, 
        she coincided with China's extremely brutal efforts to stop the spread of covid-19.This changed her perception of Chinese politics, 
        economy and even Chinese history and culture, and she made up her mind to leave China.
